# Cat-v-s-Dog-Classifier-Deep-Learning-
A simple Neural Network Model to classify Dogs and Cats.

# Requirements
1. Python 3.7.x
2. Tensorflow 2
3. (Optional)Tensorboard to track the training of the model
# Datasets
1. Training Dataset download link - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765  
It contains 12,501 RBG images of cats and dogs each.
# Note
1. Model-1 and Model-2 has been trained on the whole Dataset.  
2. Model-3 has been trained on a part of Dataset and the rest images were used for test images. 
3. Model-4 and Model-5 includes Dropout Layers to control Overfitting.
3. The pickle and the Dataset files are not included in this repositiory due to their large file size.
